Subject: Request for Digital Copy of Complaint in Case No. 1:07-cv-00990 

To Whom It May Concern, 

I am writing to formally request a digital copy of Document 1 (the Complaint) in the case Olde Monmouth Stock Transfer 
Co., Inc. v. Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, Case No. 1:07-cv-00990, filed on February 13, 2007 and referenced here:

https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/5007157/olde-monmouth-stock-transfer-co-inc-v-depository-trust-clearing/ 






###  After this, we  have  the response:

Responding to your letter of March 24, 2025, with apologies I have information for you — none of it agreeable:

First, Court policy does not permit e-mail or fax communication. The Records Department fax number and individual e-mail addresses cannot be revealed to the public;

Second, due to the age of the case and lack of activity the entire file of 07-CV-990 has been sent to storage with the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) in Lees Summit, Missouri;

Third, just to retrieve the Case from NARA would require the prepayment of **\$70.00**;

Fourth, once recovered from NARA the price to photocopy the Complaint would be **\$0.50/page**, and until we see the document we have no idea what the page count, and hence the fee, would be.

If you wish to order the Case back from NARA, please provide **\$70.00** in the form of a COMPANY CHECK, CERTIFIED CHECK, or MONEY ORDER payable to the **Clerk of the Court, SDNY**. If turn-around time is important, a Money Order is preferred because it would be treated as cash while in the case of a check nothing can be done until the check clears the bank (another Court policy).

I honestly wish I had a better answer to your request.

**Sincerely,**

**S. Klimek**
**Correspondence Clerk**
**Records Management**



**PLEASE RETURN A COPY OF THIS LETTER WITH YOUR REMITTANCE**
