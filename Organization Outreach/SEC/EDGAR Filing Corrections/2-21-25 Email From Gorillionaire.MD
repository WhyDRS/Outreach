Subject : Stray Space Character in company_tickers_exchange json file

Good evening,

My name is James Alfonse, and I am reaching out on behalf of WhyDRS, a non-profit that provides free educational resources about the U.S. financial markets. We greatly appreciate the valuable data provided by the SEC.
I wanted to bring to your attention an issue weâ€™ve noticed in the company_tickers_exchange JSON file. Specifically, the Ticker "DAIC " appears to have a trailing space. We have observed this issue since at least December. As our database relies on accurate ticker data, this stray space could cause discrepancies during data processing.

It might be helpful to implement a process to trim whitespace from the Ticker field (and possibly the CIK field as well). I have attached a screenshot below illustrating the issue.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if I can provide further assistance.




Best Regards,
James Alfonse
