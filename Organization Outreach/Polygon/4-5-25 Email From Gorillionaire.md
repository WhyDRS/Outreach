Subject : Inquiry: Nonprofit Use of Polygon API for Daily Stock Prices

Hello Polygon Team,

I hope you’re doing well! My name is James and I’m reaching out on behalf of WhyDRS, a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to democratizing access to financial data. We operate an open-source database where users can access, at no cost, company information, transfer agent and broker data, and other key metrics to inform their investment decisions.

We’re currently expanding our database to include the most recent daily closing price for all publicly traded stocks, updated once every trading day. To that end, we’re very interested in using Polygon’s market data API. However, we want to ensure we stay in full compliance with your Terms of Service and any relevant data licensing or exchange requirements.

Specifically, we’d like to:

Pull end-of-day (closing) prices for a broad range of equities.
Store and display those prices in our publicly accessible nonprofit database.
Make portions of the data (e.g., a JSON file of daily closing prices) openly available on our GitHub repository for transparency and collaboration.
Since we plan on redistributing or at least displaying Polygon’s data to end users—entirely for free, with no commercial or for-profit element—we’re reaching out to confirm whether this use case is permissible under any of Polygon’s existing plans. If not, we’d appreciate any recommendations you might have regarding Business or Enterprise plans, or even alternative data providers, to help us achieve our mission.

We’d also be eager to learn about any special terms, licensing options, or discounted arrangements for registered nonprofits, including whether it’s possible to:

Use a business-tier plan or enterprise license in a purely nonprofit capacity.
Comply with your data attribution or usage guidelines (e.g., disclaimers, footers, etc.).
Incorporate daily updates in a way that fully respects the rights of exchanges or other data sources.
In the event that Polygon isn’t able to accommodate this sort of data redistribution, we’d be grateful for any insight into next steps, other data partners, or industry best practices that could help us provide free and transparent market data.

Thank you so much for your time and consideration. We deeply value Polygon’s contributions to accessible financial data, and we look forward to hearing your thoughts on how best to proceed.

Warm regards,

James Alfonse
