Welcome to the WhyDRS Outreach Hub!

All WhyDRS members and site visitors can freely use and contribute to the outreach resources here. As a [DUNA](https://www.whydrs.org/the-first-duna), anyone can identify as a WhyDRS member and feel comfortable to reach out of their own volition to individuals or groups that may be interested.

Two categories of resources: "Community" and "Independent"

Community resources have been developed and drafted through a transparent record of communications and version history for documents. Community resources can be used with confidence in their accuracy, professionalism, and homogeny with WhyDRS goals.
Independent resources are new, written by a single individual, and either used outside of GitHub or shared here for community discussion and iteration. Once that discussion and iteration process has taken place, they can sometimes become Community resources.

Individuals can identify as a WhyDRS member and send whatever they want from their personal email for their own outreach efforts (either organized or guerilla)., but distinguishing between community resources with timestamped development here help outreach recipients understand the core messaging and perspective of WhyDRS the organization.

Types of Outreach Resources:
- Email Templates for journalists, for finance professionals, for legal groups, for grants, etc etc)
- Print / Mail resources
- Graphic Resources
